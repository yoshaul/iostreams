Set of useful, production ready, Java input and output streams.

### Requirements
------------

JDK version 1.6 or above

### Installation
------------
Add the following dependency to Maven based builds:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.iostreams</groupId>
    <artifactId>iostreams</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
### Usage
------------
One of the most useful classes in iostreams library is the `OutputToInputStream` stream.
This class allows you easily convert an `OutputSteam` to sources that expect an `InputStream`.

`OutputToInputStream` abstracts the complexities of piped streams and takes care of running the output in a separate thread. It's in use in enterprise production systems for several years.

A commons example is XML and JSON serializers that write to an `OutputStream` and you need to pass it to method that works with `InputStream`.

Here is a sample usage of the `OutputToInputStream` class:

```java
InputStream in = new OutputToInputStream() {
    protected void write(OutputStream sink) throws IOException {
        JacksonFactory.createJsonGenerator(sink).writeObject(toSerialize);
    }
};

// class that expects an input stream
FileUtils.write(targetPath, in);
```
